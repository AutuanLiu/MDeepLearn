    Automatically download MNIST dataset and return the training, validation and test set with 50000, 10000 and 10000 digit images respectively.
    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple
        The shape of digit images e.g. (-1,784) or (-1, 28, 28, 1).
    path : str
        The path that the data is downloaded to, defaults is ``data/mnist/``.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = tl.files.load_mnist_dataset(shape=(-1,784))
    >>> X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = tl.files.load_mnist_dataset(shape=(-1, 28, 28, 1))
